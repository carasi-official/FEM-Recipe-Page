## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Used media queries to handle the custom css for the mobile view. Everything else was pretty standard though.
If there is a way to solve the mobile view without media queries for the custom styling I'd be curious to learn it!
